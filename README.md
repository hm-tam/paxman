###A parallax library for making sweet static single paged websites, quickly, and by using HTML markup as config.

##TODO's
* window resize listeners
* currently using `forEach` which i think is just a webkit implementation
* incude more css transforms
* x-scrolling background
* scrolling speeds need adjusting to screen dimensions! (real bugger)
